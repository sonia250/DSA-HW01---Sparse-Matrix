## 🔢 Sparse Matrix Operations in JavaScript 

This project efficiently performs **Addition**, **Subtraction**, and **Multiplication** on large sparse matrices using plain JavaScript. It avoids external libraries and is optimized for memory usage.

### 🔧 Features:

* Loads matrices from `.txt` files with non-zero values only.
* Uses an object-based format to store matrix entries.
* Validates inputs and checks for dimension mismatches.
* Includes a simple CLI to select operations.

### 🗂️ Structure:

* `main`: Main logic (`main.js`, `usersMatrix.js`)
* `inputs/`: Matrix test files
* `README.md`: Project documentation

### 📝 Input Format:

* First two lines: matrix size (`rows=`, `cols=`)
* Following lines: `(row, col, value)` for non-zero elements

### 🚀 Run Instructions:

1. Clone the repo
2. Place files in correct folders
3. Run `node main.js` and select an operation (1-3)
